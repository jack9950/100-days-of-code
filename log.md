# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Day 1: 1 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress**: Forked the [100 Days Of Code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code); updated [Log](log.md) and [Rules](rules.md). Also changed the README to link to the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). Started the “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project. Made/edited the navbar and DIVs for each section. Coded social icons, using Font Awesome. Added contact form.

**Thoughts:** Beginning “100 Days Of Code” would be quite a challenge if you'd never used GitHub before. (Of course, it's a great chance to learn to use GitHub!) At [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), I’ve completed the Front End Development Certification lessons through “JSON APIs and Ajax” with one exception: “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.” Next up: “Intermediate Front End Development Projects."

**Learned today:** How to add jQuery and other files to a Codepen.io project. How to use alert colors as background colors in Bootstrap. How to install Font Awesome via CDN ([see how](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)), and how to code the icons (yay!).

**Link to work:** “Build a Tribute Page”: [Georgia O’Keeffe, Artist](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/mORjyd/), in which I practiced using Bootstrap. This is a Free Code Camp project I finished earlier. Today I started “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage”: [Another Free Code Camp project](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/rjBKLo/) with more Bootstrap. Today’s code [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/macloo/4448f77d928a7e3283910de0aab9f845).
