Day 2: Jan 6th 2017

**Today’s progress:**
Random Quote Machine: I finally got app resposive to mobile / phone screen. Next step: make it responsive across all screen sizes, small, medium, large and extra large.

**Thoughts:**
Bootstrap makes responsive design a lot easier. I see why it is so popular. Without it I would have to write miles of css and javascript. Based on my limited experience, this is what I guess I would have to do: First create a css grid system for each screen size. Then write the javascript to make the BOM and DOM class changes depending on the screen size. Thank you Bootstrap!

I will continue to refactor the Random Quote Machine code to be responsive to all screen sizes. Over the last week I read through the basic Bootstrap tutorials at http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/ and I will refactor code to use the Bootstrap mobile first responsive 12 column grid.

**Learned today:**
Positioning content, floats, clearfix for floats to return the document flow back to normal, typography shorthand, setting relative line height for text.

Day 1: Jan 5th 2017

**Today’s progress:**
Forked the 100-days-of-code repo at https://github.com/jack9950/100-days-of-code. Learned the basics of git and GitHub. Committed my code from the Random Quote Machine to GitHub at https://github.com/jack9950/FCC-Random-Quote-Machine.

**Thoughts:**
I am really starting to love the command line (BASH on Linux Mint). Once I got the hang of it, using command line git to push my code to GitHub was a breeze. If I am serious about becoming a developer, I have to learn how to use Version Control and so far so good with git. Long way to go learning all the nitty gritty details of git, but off to a good start.

I still need to refactor the Random Quote Machine code to be mobile responsive. I will start on this tomorrow. Over the last week I read through the basic Bootstrap tutorials at http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/ and I will refactor code to use the Bootstrap mobile first responsive 12 column grid.

**Learned today:**
Command line git: clone a repository, make changes, stage the changes, commit the changes locally and finally push the commit to remmote repository on GitHub.

## Day 3: 3 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Finished the responsive large image code (both CSS and JavaScript) for the top section of the portfolio. I might tweak the text behavior a bit more later on, but for now it's working well.

**Thoughts:** It's so time-consuming to adjust a big background image to be responsive. There's probably a library or plugin for this that I don't know about.

**Learned today:** How to combine `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center;` and write JavaScript to change the way the background behaves on a phone screen. `$(window).height()` is handy.

**Links to work:** “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” at Codepen.io: [A Free Code Camp project](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/rjBKLo/) with Bootstrap.


## Day 2: 2 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Built and implemented a working PHP sendmail page for the contact form in my “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project (see [Resources](resources.md) for link). Tested. Works. Note that my contact form is pretty much copied from [here](https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/#forms). Also added large responsive background image to About section. Added a panel to the footer.

**Thoughts:** Lots of time spent on getting that background image to behave nicely. Reworked some JavaScript I figured out previously for another project. Not done with the About section yet. Portfolio section still empty.

**Learned today:** `background-size: contain;` and `background-size: cover;` (CSS) for a responsive background image. I thought `contain` would work, but it turned out that `cover` was what I needed.

## Day 1: 1 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Forked the [100 Days Of Code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code); updated [Log](log.md) and [Rules](rules.md). Also changed the README to link to the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). Started the “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project. Made/edited the navbar and DIVs for each section. Coded social icons, using Font Awesome. Added contact form.

**Thoughts:** Beginning “100 Days Of Code” would be quite a challenge if you'd never used GitHub before. (Of course, it's a great chance to learn to use GitHub!) At [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/macloo), I’ve completed the Front End Development Certification lessons through “JSON APIs and Ajax” with one exception: “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.” Next up: “Intermediate Front End Development Projects."

**Learned today:** How to add jQuery and other files to a Codepen.io project. How to use alert colors as background colors in Bootstrap. How to install Font Awesome via CDN ([see how](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)), and how to code the icons (yay!).

**Links to work:** “Build a Tribute Page”: [Georgia O’Keeffe, Artist](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/mORjyd/), in which I practiced using Bootstrap. This is a Free Code Camp project I finished earlier. Today I started “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage”: [Another Free Code Camp project](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/rjBKLo/) with more Bootstrap. I exported today’s code [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/macloo/4448f77d928a7e3283910de0aab9f845).
